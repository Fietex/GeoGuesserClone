# GeoGuesserClone
I made this GeoguesserClone inorder to learn JS, since I never really used it.

# API_KEY
Inorder to publish the GeoGuesserClone I had to remove my API_KEY from the code. </br>
But your can insert your own API_KEY at the bottom of the HTML. </br>
Just replace <strong>YOUR_API_KEY</strong> with your own key.</br>
